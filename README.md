## About 🤔:

This is a project developed as part of the Computer Networks I course that requires students to implement a file repository with replication using a client-server model. The application operate in deposit and retrieval modes, with the server storing multiple copies of files in different locations based on client-defined fault tolerance levels.

## Resourses 🧑‍🔬:

- **File Repository:** The project allows for the storage and retrieval of files through a central server.

- **Replication:** The system supports the replication of files across different locations (devices) to ensure availability and fault tolerance.

- **Operation Modes:** The project offers two operation modes, namely, deposit mode and retrieval mode, so that clients can send files to the server and request file retrieval.

- **Fault Tolerance:** Clients can define the level of fault tolerance, determining the number of replicas stored for each file.

- **Replica Consistency:** The system maintains replica consistency, automatically adjusting the number of replicas based on client requests.

## Dependencies 🚚:

The project dependencies are described in  ```./dependencies/requirements.``` within the repository. In summary, heres what you're gonna need in order to run the project:

- [```dependencie <version>```](http:link.com).
- 

For installing dependencies more quickly, you can run the following command at terminal, inside the clonned repository:

	sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
    pip3 install -r ./dependencies/requirements.txt

Make sure you have all Dependencies before running the project.

## How to run it 🏃:

First, clone this repository. After that, simply execute the ```file_name``` file with the command:

    sudo command_for_running_project

## Development Process ⚙️:

Developers didn't use a specific methodology for development; occasionally, they would join Discord to code together.

### Tools Used 🛠️: 

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). 

## How to contribute 🫂:
